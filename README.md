A version of Pong I made from scratch (no tutorials or AI assistance) using Love2D.
I have been running it using my code editor (VS Code) but if you are familiar with Love2D you could most likely figure out how to run it/turn it into an executable.

Left Paddle: W - up, S - down
Right Paddle" Up Arrowkey - up, Down Arrowkey - down
